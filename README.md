# Address Plotter -- a web based tool plot a list of addresses around a single address using the Google Maps API

Have you ever wanted to see where a list of addresses where relative to a specific location? We wrote this code to show all the members of our church relative to the church. We updated the code so you can specify the center of the map and then add N number of addresses (delimited by a newline character) to be plotted around it.

This is currently on my website if you want to try it out:

## Setup

If you want to run this code on your site you will need to get a <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html">Google Maps API Key</a>.

## Problems ? 

Let me know if you find any problems with the code. You can also fork and fix it yourself :)
